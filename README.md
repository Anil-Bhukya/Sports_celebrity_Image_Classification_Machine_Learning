# Sports Personality Image Classifier

## Project Overview

The Sports Personality Image Classifier uses three main models Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression to identify and classify sports personalities from images. With image preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning, the project achieved an optimal accuracy with SVM.

## Key Features

→ Image processing with OpenCV for facial and eye detection  
→ Data preprocessing with StandardScaler for optimized model performance  
→ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and 5-fold cross-validation  
→ Achieved 85% accuracy with SVM, showing a 10% improvement over other models

## Technologies Used

→ Python   
→ OpenCV: For image processing and feature detection  
→ Scikit-Learn: For machine learning models and data preprocessing  
→ NumPy  
→ Matplotlib: For data visualization   

## Model Evaluation

Three models were tested: SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The models were evaluated using accuracy metrics with GridSearchCV and 5-fold cross-validation to select the best-performing model.

## Results
→ Best Model: SVM with an accuracy of 85%  
→ Performance Improvement: Hyperparameter tuning yielded a 10% accuracy   boost with SVM over other models.
